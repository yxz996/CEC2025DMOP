This repository is created for the CEC2025 competition  of dynamic multi-objective optimisation, There are two tracks of competition, briefly described as follows:  
Track 1: Dynamic Unconstrained Multi-Objective Optimisation  
Track 2: Dynamic Constrained Multi-Objective Optimisation  

All the benchmark functions have been implemented in MATLAB code, your competition results can be submitted as a brief technical report.   
Please send your results directly to Dr Xiaozhong Yu (xzyu@ smail.xtu.edu.cn)
